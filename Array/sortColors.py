#   

# Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, 
#sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, 
#with the colors in the order red, white and blue.

# Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.

# Note: You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.


# Just like the Lomuto partition algorithm usually used in quick sort. 
# We keep a loop invariant that [0,i) [i, j) [j, k) are 0s, 1s and 2s 
# sorted in place for [0,k). 
# Here ")" means exclusive. We don't need to swap because we know the values we want.
